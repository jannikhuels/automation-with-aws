# Work Up Automation with AWS 
This tutorial will walk you through using Amazon Web Services efficiently. We both cover main services and their usage but especially the automation of _everything_. Each Lab covers the following topics:  

1. Explain the service and its usage.
2. Show how to use it step-by-step.
3. Automate the tasks - make them reliably repeatable. 

We really want to focus on our point of view in the field of automation with AWS - and not just repeat what you can already find in the AWS Documentation or other sources.  

# Target Audience
People who want to improve the reliability of their IT infrastructure and the efficiency of their daily work are likely to be a good audience for this tutorial. We would like people to contribute to this Tutorial - so please do not hesitate if you have any ideas for improvements, corrections or extensions.
