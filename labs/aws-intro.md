# AWS - What the heck?
Nowadays even the very last technique affine person should have heard anything about _cloud computing_ and **A**mazon **W**eb **S**ervices. In fact we don't want to explain what AWS _is_ but what we think _how_ AWS - or even cloud computing in general - improves your business. As Gartners recent [Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure as a Service](https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-2G2O5FC&ct=150519) has shown AWS is considered to be both the market leader as well as the leading visionary. Therefore we chose AWS to be the running example for all the tutorials we introduce. However all the principles we mention can be treated platform independently.

## I, P, S or what as a Service?
The classification into several distinct _as a Service_ classes is sometimes seen skeptical. It helps to set the boundaries of the offered services and to understand their basic functionality. Nevertheless, these boundaries may sometimes be hard to determine. To make it easy: AWS offers everything.

### IaaS
The most basic services allow to setup the whole infrastructure. Create **V**irtual **P**rivate **C**louds (VPCs) and Subnets. Attach Internet facing or internal Gateways. And of course create Compute Instances (EC2) and choose their fine grained configuration to be well suited to your special needs. As known from your on premises DC you certainly are able to build your whole infrastructure using self-controlled EC2 instances. This may at first satisfy the craftsman in you. Consider **PaaS** options to really get up to speed.

### PaaS
Consider the effort of maintaining your Database system. Keeping the software up-to-date, ensuring high security standards, making it highly available and fault tolerant. Wouldn't it be great if someone else takes care and you really can focus on you business solutions? Plenty of AWS _PaaS_ solutions offer exactly that. Not only databases but also storage, messaging or even analysis systems are offered and maintained by AWS. There are plenty of services you can use within your environment.

### SaaS
It becomes really comfortable if you consum _Software as a Service_. Everything is provided through an API - but not only offered by AWS. Rather, also you can earn money by providing _SaaS_ through the AWS Marketplace. But we will come back later to that. First of all we have to concentrate on building those services.

## But the costs ...
Since AWS offers a very transparent pricing policy you are immediately confronted with prices of certain services. That is not the case when you run your own DC. You have those one-time-costs when you buy a server, but e.g. electricity prices or the price of maintaining all the hardware and software on your own are not that transparent. Thus AWS prices may suggest that it will be more expensive. On the contrary this transparency really helps to control costs.

You may have an idea for a _Proof of Concept_. Your budget is limited. Use AWS Services to stay in budget and benefit from _PaaS_ Services at the same time. You don't have to build everything from scratch and you have full cost control at all times.

You need service reliability? What may it cost to run own DCs in different regions or in different countries on different continents?

There are plenty of companies, even [very well-known ones](http://www.businessinsider.de/netflix-intuit-juniper-go-all-in-on-amazon-cloud-2016-1?r=US&IR=T), who use AWS to get successful. May it be for _PoCs_, for the benefit of using high-tech _PaaS_ offerings or even for their whole IT infrastructure. Be one of them!

## All In or nothing?
There is no such a rule. There may be certain reasons to leave some components within your on-premises datacenter but also good reasons to move all in and get the full speed out of AWS. Does your focus lie on infrastructure or does or USP consists of the software or the services you offer? Do you really need to maintain the infrastructure on your? Do you want to build everything from scratch? Do you need cheap reliability? Those are some questions you should ask yourself in order to find your best-suited cloud strategy. May it be hybrid or all-in. Use the cloud to speed up your business!

## So, conclude some benefits
Sorry for this lengthy introduction. But we hope you got a feeling for how much think of the cloud. We vow to improve and try to keep shorter in the next labs. To recap we think those are the most important benefits the cloud offers to you and especially your business:

* Keep costs low and transparent.
* Get a cheap high available and reliable infrastructure.
* Benefit from expert knowledge - don't build and maintain everything yourself.
* Accelerate your business. Implement your ideas just in time - and not when your new server arrives.
* Focus on your business!
